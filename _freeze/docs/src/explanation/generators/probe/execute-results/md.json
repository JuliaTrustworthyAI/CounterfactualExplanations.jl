It minimizes the gap between the achieved and desired recourse invalidation rates, minimizes recourse costs, and also ensures that the resulting recourse achieves a positive model prediction.\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe loss function this generator is defined below. R is a hinge loss parameter which helps control for robustness. The loss and penalty functions can still be chosen freely.\n\n``` math\n\\begin{aligned}\nR(x'; \\sigma^2 I) + l(f(x'), s) + \\lambda d_c(x', x)\n\\end{aligned}\n```\n\nR uses the following formula to control for noise. It generates small perturbations and checks how often the counterfactual explanation flips back to a factual one, when small amounts of noise are added to it.\n\n``` math\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta(x^{\\hat{E}}) &= E_{\\varepsilon}[h(x^{\\hat{E}}) - h(x^{\\hat{E}} + \\varepsilon)]\n\\end{aligned}\n```\n\nThe above formula is not differentiable. For this reason the generator uses the closed form version of the formula below.\n\n``` math\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Delta \\tilde{}(x^{\\hat{E}}, \\sigma^2 I) = 1 - \\Phi \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{f(x^{\\hat{E}})}}{\\sqrt{\\nabla f(x^{\\hat{E}})^T \\sigma^2 I \\nabla f(x^{\\hat{E}})}}\\right) \n\\end{equation}\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nGenerating a counterfactual with the data loaded and generator chosen works as follows:\n\nNote: It is important to set the convergence to \":invalidation_rate\" here.\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nM = fit_model(counterfactual_data, :DeepEnsemble)\nopt = Descent(0.01)\ngenerator = CounterfactualExplanations.Generators.ProbeGenerator(opt=opt)\nce = generate_counterfactual(x, target, counterfactual_data, M, generator, converge_when =:invalidation_rate, invalidation_rate = 0.5, learning_rate = 0.5)\nplot(ce)\n```\n:::\n\n\nChoosing different invalidation rates makes the counterfactual more or less robust.
