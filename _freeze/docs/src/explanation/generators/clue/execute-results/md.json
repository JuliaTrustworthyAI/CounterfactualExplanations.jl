It aims to provide interpretable counterfactual explanations by identifying input patterns that lead to predictive uncertainty. The generator utilizes a latent variable framework and employs a decoder from a variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate counterfactual samples in latent space.\n\nThe CLUE algorithm minimizes a loss function that combines uncertainty estimates and the distance between the generated counterfactual and the original input. By optimizing this loss function iteratively, the CLUEGenerator generates counterfactuals that are similar to the original observation but assigned low uncertainty.\n\nThe formula for predictive entropy is as follow:\n\n``` math\n\\begin{aligned}\nH(y^*|x^*, D) &= - \\sum_{k=1}^{K} p(y^*=c_k|x^*, D) \\log p(y^*=c_k|x^*, D)\n\\end{aligned}\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nWhile using one must keep in mind that the CLUE algorithim is meant to find a more robust datapoint of the same class, using CLUE generator without any additional penalties/losses will mean that it is not a counterfactual generator. The generated result will be of the same class as the original input, but a more robust datapoint.\n\nCLUE works best for BNN's. The CLUEGenerator can be used with any differentiable probabilistic model, but the results may not be as good as with BNNs.\n\nThe CLUEGenerator can be used in the following manner:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\ngenerator = CLUEGenerator()\nM = fit_model(counterfactual_data, :DeepEnsemble)\nconv = CounterfactualExplanations.Convergence.MaxIterConvergence(max_iter=1000)\nce = generate_counterfactual(\n    x, target, counterfactual_data, M, generator;\n    convergence=conv)\nplot(ce)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n![](clue_files/figure-commonmark/cell-3-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nExtra: The CLUE generator can also be used upon already having achieved a counterfactual with a different generator. In this case, you can use CLUE and make the counterfactual more robust.\n\n*Note: The above documentation is based on the information provided in the CLUE paper.
