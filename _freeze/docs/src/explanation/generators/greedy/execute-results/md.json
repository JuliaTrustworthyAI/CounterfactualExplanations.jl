It is **greedy** in the sense that it is an \"iterative algorithm that updates the most salient feature, i.e. the feature that has the largest influence on the classification, by $\\delta$ at each step\" [@schut2021generating].\n\n## Usage\n\nThe approach can be used in our package as follows:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nM = fit_model(counterfactual_data, :DeepEnsemble)\ngenerator = GreedyGenerator()\nce = generate_counterfactual(x, target, counterfactual_data, M, generator)\nplot(ce)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n![](greedy_files/figure-commonmark/cell-3-output-1.svg){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## References\n\n",
