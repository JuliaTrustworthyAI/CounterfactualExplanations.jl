# Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack

To search counterfactuals, Schut et al. (2021) propose to use a Jacobian-Based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) inspired by the literature on adversarial attacks. It works by moving in the direction of the most salient feature at a fixed step size in each iteration. Schut et al. (2021) use this optimisation rule in the context of Bayesian classifiers and demonstrate good results in terms of plausibility — how realistic counterfactuals are — and redundancy — how sparse the proposed feature changes are.

## `JSMADescent`

To implement this approach in a reusable manner, we have added JSMA as a `Flux` optimiser. In particular, we have added a class `JSMADescent<:Flux.Optimise.AbstractOptimiser`, for which we have overloaded the `Flux.Optimise.apply!` method. This makes it possible to reuse `JSMADescent` as an optimiser in composable generators.

The optimiser can be used with with any generator as follows:

``` julia
using CounterfactualExplanations.Generators: JSMADescent
generator = GenericGenerator() |>
    gen -> @with_optimiser(gen,JSMADescent(;η=0.1))
ce = generate_counterfactual(x, target, counterfactual_data, M, generator)
```

The figure below compares the resulting counterfactual search outcome to the corresponding outcome with generic `Descent`.

``` julia
plot(p1,p2,size=(1000,400))
```
