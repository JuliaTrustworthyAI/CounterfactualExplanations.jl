        "\n",
        "Feature Tweak is a powerful recourse algorithm for ensembles of tree-based classifiers such as random forests. Though the problem of understanding how an input to an ensemble model could be transformed in such a way that the model changes its original prediction has been proven to be NP-hard [@tolomei2017interpretable], Feature Tweak provides an algorithm that manages to tractably solve this problem in multiple real-world applications. An example of a problem Feature Tweak is able to efficiently solve, explored in depth in @tolomei2017interpretable is the problem of transforming an advertisement that has been classified by the ensemble model as a low-quality advertisement to a high-quality one through small changes to its features. With the help of Feature Tweak, advertisers can both learn about the reasons a particular ad was marked to have a low quality, as well as receive actionable suggestions about how to convert a low-quality ad into a high-quality one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Though Feature Tweak is a powerful way of avoiding brute-force search in an exponential search space, it does not come without disadvantages. The primary limitations of the approach are that it's currently only applicable to tree-based classifiers and works only in the setting of binary classification. Another problem is that though the algorithm avoids exponential-time search, it is often still computationally expensive. The algorithm may be improved in the future to tackle all of these shortcomings.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following equation displays how a true negative instance x can be transformed into a positively predicted instance **x'**. To be more precise, **x'** is the best possible transformation among all transformations **x\\***, computed with a cost function Î´.\n",
