# Contributing

Our goal is to provide a go-to place for Counterfactual Explanations in Julia. To this end, the following is a non-exhaustive list of enhancements we have planned:

1.  Additional counterfactual generators and predictive models.
2.  Additional datasets for testing, evaluation and benchmarking.
3.  Support for regression models.

For a complete list, have a look at outstanding [issue](https://github.com/juliatrustworthyai/CounterfactualExplanations.jl/issues).
