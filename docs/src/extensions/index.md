# ⛓️ Extensions

In this section, you will find information about package extensions of the `CounterfactualExplanations` package. [Extensions](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/#Conditional-loading-of-code-in-packages-(Extensions)) are a relatively new feature of Julia that allows users to conditionally load code based on the presence of other packages. This is useful for creating packages that extend the functionality of other packages, without requiring the user to install the package being extended.
