## Package Architecture

> Modular, composable, scalable! 

The diagram below provides an overview of the package architecture. It is built around two core modules that are designed to be as extensible as possible through dispatch: 1) `Models` is concerned with making any arbitrary model compatible with the package; 2) `Generators` is used to implement arbitrary counterfactual search algorithms.^[We have made an effort to keep the code base a flexible and extensible as possible, but cannot guarantee at this point that any counterfactual generator can be implemented without further adaptation.] The core function of the package `generate_counterfactual` uses an instance of type `<: AbstractFittedModel` produced by the `Models` module and an instance of type `<: AbstractGenerator` produced by the `Generators` module.
