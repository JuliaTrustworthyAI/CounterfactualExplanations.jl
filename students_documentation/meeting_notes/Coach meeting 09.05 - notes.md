# Coach meeting 09.05 

## Project Plan feedback

- Most of the project plan is clear
- We could add something about 'decision tree' to show why a certain decision was made in the ML model but it's not necessary since we're going to work with evo trees
- Risks about client not being available to help us are important stakeholders' concerns
- For now, the unavailability of the client doesn't bother us, but we should be cautious as it might become a problem in the future
- Testing of additional models: we will address this further down the project
- Quarto allows a mix of R and Python in one notebook, which might be useful to use. A good notebook would be a valuable asset for the client, presentations, etc. We should spend some time collecting all the results we have.
- We could work along with a notebook throughout the whole project to gather examples of what we've done. It would be challenging to summarize everything at the very end. Document everything we do in the coming weeks.
- The role of CARLA is quite unclear (?).
- Feasibility study: It is basically clear (very good that we mentioned our client won't be available). We should always be sharper, give a demo, etc. The client can follow what's going on in the repository, so it's important to regularly meet with the client and maintain good contact.
- Make sure the client will be present for the midterm meeting (could be remotely).
- The list of requirements is quite clear, but we could add some dependencies between different parts. We could try to add a UML diagram to our report to easily visualize dependencies. It's much harder to debate in a meeting when you don't know the dependencies. Having a diagram is handy for presentations, for instance.
- It's good to create a notebook to use during a conference, post online, and for demonstration purposes. A notebook (Pluto or Quarto) will be very useful for us to create such a presentation. We could make comparisons between Julia and Python running time, which would help us understand our own creation better. The final decision is up to us, obviously.
- Non-functional requirements: Ethical problems should be considered, and we should state that we are aware of the problems but not responsible for solving them. The client should pay close attention to the problem.
- We need to evaluate how things are going every week, whether we are missing deadlines, etc. It's important to evaluate frequently and maintain close contact with the client.

## To do
