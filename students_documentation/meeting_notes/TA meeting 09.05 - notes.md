# TA meeting 09.05

## Grading

- **Research Part**: Filled by the coach mainly. TA and client can add something if needed.
- **Product Part**: Client intervenes only in the "Meets Expectations" part, the rest is graded by the course staff. Everyone besides the coach will read our report.
- **Process Part**: TA input. Did we incorporate feedback? Did we plan stuff beforehand?

### Planning Part
- Follow TA's instructions. If we cannot do something, contact TA. For an excellent grade, we should properly fulfill all requirements and add something specific to our problem. For example, daily meetings or contacting people outside our project to find similar topics, packages, and learn from their planning and mistakes.

### Creativity Part
- Do something extra. For a sufficient grade, we need to fulfill all the client's requests, but we should also take the initiative and not rely too much on the client.

### Communication/Interaction
- We need to be respectful and responsive.

### Design/Software Quality
- Document the steps we took to ensure good software quality. Have a pipeline with tests and checkstyles. For better grades, consider tests for specific domains, proper deployment of AI/ML models, code refactoring to improve it, running metrics to evaluate code quality, and improving the software as much as possible.
- Creating an architecture is important. We can follow Patrick's architecture, which is good. For an excellent grade, pinpoint what's wrong with the architecture and provide a PDF or an extended architecture that makes it easy to build upon it in the future.

### Quality of Documentation
- For the Readme, add it somewhere else and split the documentation. Extend the documentation, pinpoint where it is, and indicate which parts we have completed. Include diagrams in our report (process, architecture, comments in the code, etc.).

### Contact with the coach
- Contact our coach mainly when we want feedback on feasibility. He can guide us and protect us from taking on too much work. He knows how much work is enough.

## Problems with Mirroring
There are issues with the mirroring process, such as failing pipelines. TA will contact other people to find a solution and update us.

## Midterm Part
TA and coach need to receive the presentation. The client can have another meeting, and TA can attend as well.

## Next Week
Online meeting.

Transport the project plan into our repository (milestones, deadlines, and issues). We should have some prototypes, even something that simply performs a basic function. A notebook would be a sufficient solution.
