We have noted elsewhere that the effectiveness of counterfactual explanations depends to some degree on the quality of the fitted model. Another, perhaps trivial, thing to note is that counterfactual explanations are not unique: there are potentially many valid counterfactual paths. One interesting (or silly) idea following these two observations might be to introduce some form of regularization in the counterfactual search. For example, we could use dropout to randomly switch features on and off in each iteration.

In other words, counterfactuals generated in this way would generally not be plausible.

Neither the behaviour of differentiable tree-based models nor their interplay with counterfactual explanations is well understood at this point. If you encounter any issues, please report them to the package maintainers. Your feedback is highly appreciated.Please also note that this extension is only tested on Julia 1.9 and higher, due to compatibility issues.","category":"page"},{"location":"extensions/neurotree/#Example","page":"NeuroTrees","title":"Example","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"extensions/neurotree/","page":"NeuroTrees","title":"NeuroTrees","text":"The extension will be loaded automatically when loading the NeuroTreeModels package (assuming the CounterfactualExplanations package is also loaded).","category":"page"},{"location":"extensions/neurotree/","page":"NeuroTrees","title":"NeuroTrees","text":"using NeuroTreeModels","category":"page"},{"location":"extensions/neurotree/","page":"NeuroTrees","title":"NeuroTrees","text":"Next, we will fit a NeuroTree model to the moons dataset using our standard package API for doing so.","category":"page"},{"location":"extensions/neurotree/","page":"NeuroTrees","title":"NeuroTrees","text":"# Fit model to data:\ndata = CounterfactualData(load_moons()...)\nM = fit_model(\n    data, :NeuroTree; \n    depth=2, lr=5e-2, nrounds=50, batchsize=10\n)","category":"page"},{"location":"extensions/neurotree/","page":"NeuroTrees","title":"NeuroTrees","text":"NeuroTreeExt.NeuroTreeModel(NeuroTreeRegressor(loss = mlogloss, …), :classification_multi, NeuroTreeModels.NeuroTreeModel{NeuroTreeModels.MLogLoss, Chain{Tuple{BatchNorm{typeof(identity), Vector{Float32}, Float32, Vector{Float32}}, NeuroTreeModels.StackTree}}}(NeuroTreeModels.MLogLoss, Chain(BatchNorm(2, active=false), NeuroTreeModels.StackTree(NeuroTree[NeuroTree{Matrix{Float32}, Vector{Float32}, Array{Float32, 3}}(Float32[1.8824593 -0.28222033; -2.680499 0.67347014; … ; -1.0722864 1.3651229; -2.0926774 1.63557], Float32[-3.4070241, 4.545113, 1.0882677, -0.3497498, -2.766766, 1.9072449, -0.9736261, 3.9750721, 1.726214, 3.7279263  …  -0.0664266, -0.4214582, -2.3816268, -3.1371245, 0.76548636, 2.636373, 2.4558601, 0.893434, -1.9484522, 4.793434], Float32[3.44271 -6.334693 -0.6308845 3.385659; -3.4316056 6.297003 0.7254221 -3.3283486;;; -3.7011054 -0.17596768 0.15429471 2.270125; 3.4926674 0.026218029 -0.19753197 -2.2337704;;; 1.1795454 -4.315231 0.28486454 1.9995956; -0.9651108 4.0999455 -0.05312265 -1.8039354;;; … ;;; 2.5076811 -0.46358463 -3.5438805 0.0686823; -2.592356 0.47884527 3.781507 -0.022692114;;; -0.59115165 -3.234046 0.09896194 2.375202; 0.5592871 3.3082843 -0.014032216 -2.1876256;;; 2.039389 -0.10134532 2.6637273 -4.999703; -2.0289893 0.3368772 -2.5739825 5.069934], tanh)])), Dict{Symbol, Any}(:feature_names => [:x1, :x2], :nrounds => 50, :device => :cpu)))","category":"page"},{"location":"extensions/neurotree/","page":"NeuroTrees","title":"NeuroTrees","text":"Finally, we select a factual instance and generate a counterfactual explanation for it using the generic gradient-based CE method.","category":"page"},{"location":"extensions/neurotree/","page":"NeuroTrees","title":"NeuroTrees","text":"# Select a factual instance:\ntarget = 1\nfactual = 0\nchosen = rand(findall(predict_label(M, data) .== factual))\nx = select_factual(data, chosen)\n\n# Generate counterfactual explanation:\nη = 0.01\ngenerator = GenericGenerator(; opt=Descent(η), λ=0.01)\nconv = CounterfactualExplanations.Convergence.DecisionThresholdConvergence(;\n    decision_threshold=0.9, max_iter=100\n)\nce = generate_counterfactual(x, target, data, M, generator; convergence=conv)\nplot(ce, alpha=0.1)","category":"page"},{"location":"extensions/neurotree/","page":"NeuroTrees","title":"NeuroTrees","text":"(Image: )","category":"page"},{"location":"extensions/neurotree/#References","page":"NeuroTrees","title":"References","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"extensions/neurotree/","page":"NeuroTrees","title":"NeuroTrees","text":"Grinsztajn, Léo, Edouard Oyallon, and Gaël Varoquaux. 2022. “Why Do Tree-Based Models Still Outperform Deep Learning on Tabular Data?” https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08815.","category":"page"}]
