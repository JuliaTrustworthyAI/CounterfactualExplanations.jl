We have noted elsewhere that the effectiveness of counterfactual explanations depends to some degree on the quality of the fitted model. Another, perhaps trivial, thing to note is that counterfactual explanations are not unique: there are potentially many valid counterfactual paths. One interesting (or silly) idea following these two observations might be to introduce some form of regularization in the counterfactual search. For example, we could use dropout to randomly switch features on and off in each iteration.

With respect to Algorithmic Recourse, it is certainly true that counterfactuals should be realistic in order to be actionable for individuals.[1] To address this need, researchers have come up with various approaches in recent years. Among the most popular approaches is Latent Space Search, which was first proposed in Joshi et al. (2019): instead of traversing the feature space directly, this approach relies on a separate generative model that learns a latent space representation of the DGP.
