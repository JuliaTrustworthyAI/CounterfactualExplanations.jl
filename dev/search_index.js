We have noted elsewhere that the effectiveness of ounterfactual explanations depends to some degree on the quality of the fitted model. Another, perhaps trivial, thing to note is that counterfactual explanations are not unique: there are potentially many valid counterfactual paths. One interesting (or silly) idea following these two observations might be to introduce some form of regularization in the counterfactual search. For example, we could use dropout to randomly switch features on and off in each iteration. Without dwelling further on the usefulness of this idea, let us see how it can be implemented.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/generators/","page":"Custom generators","title":"Custom generators","text":"The first code chunk below implements two important steps: 1) create an abstract subtype of the AbstractGradientBasedGenerator and 2) create a constructor similar to the GenericConstructor, but with one additional field for the probability of dropout.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/generators/","page":"Custom generators","title":"Custom generators","text":"# Abstract suptype:\nabstract type AbstractDropoutGenerator <: AbstractGradientBasedGenerator end\n\n# Constructor:\nstruct DropoutGenerator <: AbstractDropoutGenerator\n    loss::Symbol # loss function\n    complexity::Function # complexity function\n    mutability::Union{Nothing,Vector{Symbol}} # mutibility constraints \n    λ::AbstractFloat # strength of penalty\n    ϵ::AbstractFloat # step size\n    τ::AbstractFloat # tolerance for convergence\n    p_dropout::AbstractFloat # dropout rate\nend\n\n# Instantiate:\nusing LinearAlgebra\ngenerator = DropoutGenerator(\n    :logitbinarycrossentropy,\n    norm,\n    nothing,\n    0.1,\n    0.1,\n    1e-5,\n    0.5\n)","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/generators/","page":"Custom generators","title":"Custom generators","text":"Next, we define how feature perturbations are generated for our dropout generator: in particular, we extend the relevant function through a method that implemented the dropout logic.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/generators/","page":"Custom generators","title":"Custom generators","text":"import CounterfactualExplanations.Generators: generate_perturbations, ∇\nusing StatsBase\nfunction generate_perturbations(generator::AbstractDropoutGenerator, counterfactual_state::CounterfactualState)\n    𝐠ₜ = ∇(generator, counterfactual_state) # gradient\n    # Dropout:\n    set_to_zero = sample(1:length(𝐠ₜ),Int(round(generator.p_dropout*length(𝐠ₜ))),replace=false)\n    𝐠ₜ[set_to_zero] .= 0\n    Δx′ = - (generator.ϵ .* 𝐠ₜ) # gradient step\n    return Δx′\nend","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/generators/","page":"Custom generators","title":"Custom generators","text":"Finally, we proceed to generate counterfactuals in the same way we always do.

Eventually the aim for this project is to offer a one-stop-shop of counterfactual explanations. We want to deliver a package that is at least at par with the CARLA Python library in terms of its functionality. Contrary to CARLA, we aim for languague interoperability.
