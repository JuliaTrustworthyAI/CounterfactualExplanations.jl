    "3. **The choice of the loss function matters**: the distance-based MSE does **NOT** work without further ajustments when optimizing with respect to logits, as discussed above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, in the context of this toy example log **loss arguably generates the most reasonable outcome**: firstly, we can observe that the step size decreases at an increasing rate as the search approaches convergence (which may be desirable); secondly, it appears that increasing $\\lambda$ leads to a roughly proportional decrease in the distance of the final counterfactual. This stands in contrast to the outcome for Hinge loss, where increasing $\\lambda$ from $0$ to $1$ barely has any effect at all."
