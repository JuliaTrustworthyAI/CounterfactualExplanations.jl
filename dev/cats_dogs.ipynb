    "The generic search above yielded a counterfactual sample that is still quite distinct from all other individuals in the target class. While we successfully fooled the black-box model, a human might look at üê±'s counterfactual self and get a little suspicious. One of the requirements for algorithmic recourse is that counterfactuals are realistic and unambigous. A straight-forward way to meet this requirement is to generate counterfactuals by implicitly minimizing predictive uncertainty. The plugin estimator underlying the black-box model above does not incorporate uncertainty: even in areas free of any data the neural network predicts labels with high confidence. Its Bayesian counterpart is much more conservative. By maximizing the predicted probability of the Bayesian model in @fig-recourse-laplace below, we implicitly minimize the predictive uncertainty around the counterfactual [@schut2021generating]. This way we end up generating a counterfactual that looks more like the individuals in the target class and is therefore more realistic. "
