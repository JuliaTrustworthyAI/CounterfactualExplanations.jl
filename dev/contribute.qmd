# Contributing

Our goal is to provide a go-to place for Counterfactual Explanations in Julia. To this end, the following is a non-exhaustive list of enhancements we have planned:

1. Additional counterfactual generators and predictive models.
2. Additional datasets for testing, evaluation and benchmarking.
3. Support for regression models.

For a complete list, have a look at outstanding [issue](https://github.com/pat-alt/CounterfactualExplanations.jl/issues).
