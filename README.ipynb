        "\n",
        "Machine learning models like Deep Neural Networks have become so complex, opaque and underspecified in the data that they are generally considered Black Boxes. Nonetheless, such models often play a key role in data-driven decision-making systems. This creates the following problem: human operators in charge of such systems have to rely on them blindly, while those individuals subject to them generally have no way of challenging an undesirable outcome:\n",

        "## 🔮 Enter: Counterfactual Explanations\n",
        "\n",
        "Counterfactual Explanations can help human stakeholders make sense of the systems they develop, use or endure: they explain how inputs into a system need to change for it to produce different decisions. Explainability benefits internal as well as external quality assurance.\n",

        "Counterfactual Explanations have a few properties that are desirable in the context of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). These include:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Full fidelity to the black-box model, since no proxy is involved.\n",
        "-   No need for (reasonably) interpretable features as opposed to LIME and SHAP.\n",
        "-   Clear link to Algorithmic Recourse and Causal Inference.\n",
        "-   Less susceptible to adversarial attacks than LIME and SHAP.\n",

        "\n",
        "The goal of this library is to contribute to efforts towards trustworthy machine learning in Julia. The Julia language has an edge when it comes to trustworthiness: it is very transparent. Packages like this one are generally written in pure Julia, which makes it easy for users and developers to understand and contribute to open-source code. Eventually, this project aims to offer a one-stop-shop of counterfactual explanations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our ambition is to enhance the package through the following features:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Support for all supervised machine learning models trained in [`MLJ.jl`](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/).\n",
        "2.  Support for regression models.\n",

        "Contributions of any kind are very much welcome! Take a look at the [issue](https://github.com/juliatrustworthyai/CounterfactualExplanations.jl/issues) to see what things we are currently working on. If you have an idea for a new feature or want to report a bug, please open a new issue. \n",
